## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It provides a vast collection of coding challenges that cover a wide range of algorithms and data structures. This repository aims to provide well-documented solutions to these problems, helping you to prepare effectively for coding interviews.

## Structure

I have solved various LeetCode problems in Java programming. Topics include Array, String, Sorting, Searching, Two pointers, Sliding-window, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, Stack, Recursion, Queue, Heap, Backtracking, Tree, Graph, Greedy,  Dynamic Programming etc. Each solution is organized in a directory corresponding to its problem number and title. The solutions are written in Markdown format, providing a detailed explanation of the approach, time and space complexity analysis, and the solution code.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply navigate to the problem you are interested in and open the corresponding Markdown file. Each file contains:

- Problem statement
- Approach and explanation
- Solution code
- Complexity analysis

This structured approach will help you understand the problem-solving techniques and apply them to similar problems.
